Now you have Git installed, there are a number of ways to use it. The easiest way is to use a client, which allows you to use buttons instead of typing code. They also provide a visual for more complicated ideas, such as branching, greatly simplifying the process. I prefer to use the SourceTree client, but you can use others. GitKraken is a good alternative, and nicely, it also works on Linux, which many clients donâ€™t. I have had some issues connecting SourceTree with GitHub, so have moved towards GitKraken for some projects, and have no qualms with it so far.
