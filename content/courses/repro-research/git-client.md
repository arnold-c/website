Now you have Git installed, there are a number of ways to use it. The easiest way is to use a client, which allows you to use buttons instead of typing code. They also provide a visual for more complicated ideas, such as branching, greatly simplifying the process. I prefer to use the [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) client, and they're associated GloBoards for project To-Do's, but you can use others.[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is another good alternative, but I have had some issues connecting to some GitHub accounts, so I have since moved away from it.
