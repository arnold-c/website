As mentioned, a version control system is an integral part of any reproducible research project. Think of it as tracked changes for your code. When working on a project, even if you're the only one coding, it's important to be able to go back to previous versions if you make a mistake and can't remember all the steps you went through since your last stable version. Git isn't the only VCS available, but it's the most prevalent, and has a good support community, so is what will be the focus in this book.
