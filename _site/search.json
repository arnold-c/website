I previously\n            worked as a clinical research coordinator in the Infectious\n            Disease Division at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto,\n            Canada), and concurrently completed an MSc in Global Health\n            Policy at LSHTM. Whilst completing my Masters in\n            computational chemistry, I realized that I enjoyed research\n            and computational modeling, but wanted to work in a more\n            applied healthcare-related field. Since then, I have applied\n            and developed my skills in Public Health research.\n            My research interests are in infectious disease\n            epidemiology, with a particular focus on the use of\n            mathematical models to improve outbreak response and\n            resource utilization. I primarily work with R and Julia, but\n            have experience with Python, Bash, and am learning Stan for\n            Bayesian modeling.\n            When I’m not working, I can be found outside doing one of\n            the following (depending on the season): mountain biking,\n            road cycling, rock climbing, hiking, snowboarding,\n            cross-country skiing, or very occasionally, running.\n            \n            \n            Education\n            PhD Biology, 2020 - Present,\n            Pennsylvania State University\n            MSc Global Health Policy, 2017 - 2020,\n            London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\n            MChem Chemistry, 2011 - 2015,\n            University of Oxford\n            \n            \n            Research Experience\n            \n            PhD Student, Aug 2020 – Present,\n            Pennsylvania State University\n            Infectious disease epidemiology and modelling with\n            Dr. Matt Ferrari.\n            Currently working on:\n            The Data4Action\n            Research Project examing the dynamics of COVID-19 in a\n            university community\n            Resource utilisation strategies for measles surveillance\n            and detection in the DRC\n            \n            \n            Clinical Research Coordinator, Apr 2018\n            – Dec 2019, The Hospital for Sick Children\n            Coordinated a multi-centre observational study into\n            waning immunity in infants to measles, mumps and varicella,\n            and managed all data produced by the National Microbiology\n            Laboratory and the Nova Scotia Health Authority\n            laboratory.\n            Responsibilities included:\n            Data Management\n            Data Analysis\n            Grant Applications\n            Patient enrollment and consent\n            \n            \n            Honorary Clinical Researcher, Jun 2016 -\n            May 2019, BOTNAR, University of Oxford\n            Responsibilities included:\n            Data Analysis\n            4-D CT Analysis\n            MRI Segmentation\n            Contributing researcher in multicentre FAIM study\n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Callum Arnold\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Google Scholar\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      ORCID\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      Email\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n              About Me\n              I am a PhD Student in Biology at Pennsylvania State\n              University, where I build mathematical models of\n              infectious diseases as part of Dr. Matt Ferrari’s lab\n              (within the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics), in\n              addition to other infectious disease epidemiology work.

We\nhave recently published a the interim serological results in Nature\nScientific Reports, which can be found here. The second\npart of the project focuses on relating the differential exposures\nobserved in the student cohort to latent risk profiles, examining the\npotential impact of interventions to reduce infections.\nMSF Epicentre - UrgEpi\n\n\nAn ongoing collaboration with Médecin Sans Frontières’ (MSF)\nEpicentre unit to analyze measles seroprevalence in the ex-Katanga\nregion of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The intial project\nexamined the role of new laboratory testing facilities on the speed of\ndiagnosis and outbreak response decisions. The second project examines\nthe impact of Supplemental Immunization Activities in the ex-Katanga\nregion; principally, characterizing the spatial and age-specific\nseronegativity, and examining the relationship between optical density\n(OD) distributions and seropositivity thresholds using finite mixture\nmodels.\nPast Projects\nWaning Measles Immunity\nA prospective cross-sectional serology study of Canadian newborns and\nmothers assessing the rate of waning measles, varicella, and mumps\nantibodies in infants, including subgroup analysis by vaccination\nstatus. A retrospective analysis of waning measles antibody titers\n(PRNT) in stored sera from a separate cohort of Canadian newborns was\npublished as part of the study, and can be found here\n\n\n\n",
