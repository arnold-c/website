## Current Projects
### Data4Action <a href="https://www.github.com/arnold-c/Data4Action"> <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>

A longitudinal cohort study, comprising of two geographically related cohorts, 
that aims to examine the effect of Penn State University students on the 
SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the surrounding community. We have recently published a
the interim serological results in Nature Scientific Reports, which can be 
found [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12499-5). The second part of
the project focuses on relating the differential exposures observed in the 
student cohort to latent risk profiles, examining the potential impact of interventions to reduce infections.

### MSF Epicentre - UrgEpi <a href="https://www.github.com/arnold-c/drc-urgepi"> <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>

An ongoing collaboration with Médecin Sans Frontières' (MSF) Epicentre unit to
analyze measles seroprevalence in the ex-Katanga region of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC). The intial project examined the role of new laboratory 
testing facilities on the speed of diagnosis and outbreak response decisions. 
The second project examines the impact of Supplemental Immunization Activities 
in the ex-Katanga region; principally, characterizing the spatial and age-specific seronegativity, and examining the relationship between optical density (OD) distributions and seropositivity thresholds using finite mixture models.

## Past Projects
### Waning Measles Immunity

A prospective cross-sectional serology study of Canadian newborns and mothers
assessing the rate of waning measles, varicella, and mumps antibodies in infants, 
including subgroup analysis by vaccination status. A retrospective analysis of 
waning measles antibody titers (PRNT) in stored sera from a separate cohort of 
Canadian newborns was published as part of the study, and can be found 
[here](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-0630)
